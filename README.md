## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This website was built as a profile to show to future companies I applied to in order for them to be able to get to know me, see previous works I have done, and have a way to reach out to me. It also allows for the website to be readable and organized no matter the device it's being viewed on. It helped me learn how to structure a website no matter the size of the screen as people mostly view websites on their phones first.

To navigate through the website, if you hover over either the 'about me, work, or contact' on the navigation section of the website, it will change color and if you click on either of them, then it will scroll to that part of the website for you so you don't have to scroll. When you are on the work section of the website, if you hover over the image, it changes color and if you click on it, you will be directed to the website. On the contact section, if you click on either the phone or email link then you will be able call or email.
